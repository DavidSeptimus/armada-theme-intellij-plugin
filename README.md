# Armada IntelliJ Theme

---

This is a JetBrains IDE plugin that aims to faithfully recreate the Fleet theme to IntelliJ-based IDEs.

IntelliJ's tokens don't perfectly match Fleet's, so some colors may not be 100% accurate. However, the goal is to get as close as possible.
Where there are differences, I intend to add custom annotators to make the colors more accurate over time.

The theme currently includes dark mode UI elements and the Fleet Dark theme. Light mode is not yet implemented.
