# Armada IntelliJ Theme

---

## Description

<!-- Plugin description -->
Armada is a plugin that aims to faithfully recreate the Fleet theme to IntelliJ-based IDEs.

Features:
- Fleet Dark UI and Editor Color Scheme
<!-- Plugin description end -->

IntelliJ's tokens don't perfectly match Fleet's, so some colors may not be 100% accurate. However, the goal is to get as
close as possible.
Where there are differences, I intend to add custom annotators to make the colors more accurate over time.
