## Description

<!-- Plugin description -->
Armada is a plugin that aims to faithfully recreate the Fleet's builtin themes for IntelliJ-based IDEs.

### Features

- Fleet-inspired Dark and Light UI themes/Editor Color Schemes
- Includes UI theme variants for all UI versions:
  - [Islands](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2025/09/islands-theme-the-new-look-coming-to-jetbrains-ides/) (2025.2.3+)
  - New UI (default since 2024.2)
  - [Classic UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24468-classic-ui)
- Custom highlighting tokens for improved highlighting accuracy in various languages

<!-- Plugin description end -->

IntelliJ's tokens don't perfectly match Fleet's, so some colors may not be 100% accurate. However, the goal is to get as
close as possible.
Where there are differences, I intend to add custom annotators to make the colors more accurate over time.
